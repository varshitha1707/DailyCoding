# DAILY CODING

### DAY 1:
TASK: Given a number N, print all numbers in the range from 1 to N having exactly 3 divisors.

### My Solution: [ClickHere](https://github.com/varshitha1707/DailyCoding/tree/main/DAY-1)
Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2/2)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

#

### DAY 2:
TASK: Given two integers ‘a’ and ‘m’, find modular multiplicative inverse of ‘a’ under modulo ‘m’. The modular multiplicative inverse is an integer ‘x’ such that. 
a x ≅ 1 (mod m)
The value of x should be in {0, 1, 2, … m-1}, i.e., in the range of integer modulo m.

### DAY 3:
TASK: Given an array of integers, find the first repeating element in it. We need to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest.

### DAY 4:
TASK: Given an array arr[] of size n where every element is in range from 0 to n-1. Rearrange the given array so that arr[i] becomes arr[arr[i]]. This should be done with O(1) extra space.
