# DAILY CODING

### DAY 1:
TASK: Given a number N, print all numbers in the range from 1 to N having exactly 3 divisors.

### My Solution: [ClickHere](https://github.com/varshitha1707/DailyCoding/tree/main/DAY-1)
Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2/2)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

#

### DAY 2:
TASK: Given two integers ‘a’ and ‘m’, find modular multiplicative inverse of ‘a’ under modulo ‘m’. The modular multiplicative inverse is an integer ‘x’ such that. 
a x ≅ 1 (mod m)
The value of x should be in {0, 1, 2, … m-1}, i.e., in the range of integer modulo m.

Expected Time Complexity: O(m)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

### DAY 3:
TASK: Given an array of integers, find the first repeating element in it. We need to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2-n)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

#

### DAY 4:
TASK: Given an array arr[] of size n where every element is in range from 0 to n-1. Rearrange the given array so that arr[i] becomes arr[arr[i]]. This should be done with O(1) extra space.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

### DAY 5:
TASK: Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

#

### DAY 6:
TASK: We are given two sorted arrays. We need to merge these two arrays such that the initial numbers (after complete sorting) are in the first array and the remaining numbers are in the second array. Extra space allowed in O(1).

### My Solution: [ClickHere](https://github.com/varshitha1707/DailyCoding/tree/main/DAY-6)
Expected Time Complexity: O(n*m)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

#

### DAY 7:
TASK: An element in a sorted array can be found in O(log n) time via binary search. But suppose we rotate an ascending order sorted array at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Devise a way to find an element in the rotated array in O(log n) time.

### My Solution: [ClickHere](https://github.com/varshitha1707/DailyCoding/tree/main/DAY-7)
Expected Time Complexity: O(log(n))

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

#

### DAY 8:
TASK: Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves. Write the merge function along with the whole program. 

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/

### My Solution: [ClickHere](https://github.com/varshitha1707/DailyCoding/tree/main/DAY-8)
Expected Time Complexity: O(n) (Only for the merge() function)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


#

### DAY 9:
TASK: Given two sorted arrays, find their union.

### My Solution: [ClickHere](https://github.com/varshitha1707/DailyCoding/tree/main/DAY-9)
Expected Time Complexity: O(n+m) 

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n+m)

#

### DAY 10:
TASK: Given two sorted arrays, find their intersection. 

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-and-intersection-of-two-sorted-arrays-2/

### My Solution: [ClickHere](https://github.com/varshitha1707/DailyCoding/tree/main/DAY-10)
